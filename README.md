# Weather Dashboard

Overview:
The goal of this project is to develop a responsive web application using React that provides users with current weather information based on their search by city name. The application will display essential weather details such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed in an appealing and user-friendly interface suitable for both desktop and mobile views.

Key Features:

Search Functionality: Implement a search feature allowing users to input a city name and retrieve current weather data for that location.
Current Weather Details: Display the current weather details for the searched city, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
Responsive Design: Ensure the application's layout and user interface are responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes and device types, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Technical Requirements:

React Framework: Utilize React.js to build the frontend components and manage application state efficiently.
API Integration: Integrate with a reliable weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap API) to fetch real-time weather data based on user queries.
Styling: Implement modern and visually appealing UI design using CSS or CSS frameworks like tailwind, ensuring a consistent and intuitive user experience across devices.

Additional Features (Optional):

Forecast Display: Extend the application to include a forecast section, showcasing weather predictions for the upcoming days.
Geolocation: Implement geolocation functionality to automatically detect the user's location and display the current weather without manual input.
Unit Conversion: Provide options for users to switch between different units of measurement (e.g., Celsius for temperature, kmph for wind speed).

Project Deliverables:

Frontend Implementation: Develop the React-based frontend application with the specified features and user interface.
API Integration: Successfully integrate the weather API to fetch current weather data for the entered city names.
Responsive Design: Ensure the application is responsive and compatible with various screen sizes and devices.
